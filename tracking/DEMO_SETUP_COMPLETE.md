# âœ… DEMO MODE SETUP COMPLETE!

## ðŸŽ‰ What's Done

All API calls have been replaced with dummy data. The app now works **completely offline** with realistic mock data!

### Files Created:
1. âœ… `app/utils/dummyData.ts` - Complete dummy data set
2. âœ… `DEMO_MODE_README.md` - Full documentation
3. âœ… `DEMO_CREDENTIALS.txt` - Quick reference card

### Files Modified:
1. âœ… `app/index.tsx` - Uses `mockLogin` and `mockRegister`
2. âœ… `app/screens/StudentDashboard.tsx` - Uses `dummyClasses`
3. âœ… `app/screens/TeacherDashboard.tsx` - Uses `dummyTeacherClasses`
4. âœ… `app/screens/AdminDashboard.tsx` - Uses `dummyAdminDashboard`
